# Build Failure Recovery

This document outlines general steps to take when encountering build failures in your project.

*   **Review the Build Logs:** The first step is always to examine the build logs. Look for specific error messages, file paths, and line numbers that indicate the cause of the failure.
*   **Check Recent Code Changes:** If the build was successful previously, consider what recent code changes might have introduced the error. Reverting to a working commit can help isolate the issue.
*   **Verify Dependencies:** Ensure all project dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with each other. Outdated or conflicting dependencies are a common cause of build failures.
*   **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a clean build is necessary to resolve caching or leftover file issues. Look for options in your build tools or IDE to perform a clean build.
*   **Consult Documentation and Community:** If the error message is unclear or you're unable to diagnose the problem, consult the documentation for your build tools, frameworks, or libraries. Searching online forums and communities for the specific error message can also provide solutions.
*   **Check Environment Configuration:** Ensure your build environment is set up correctly, including the correct version of your programming language, compiler, and any required environment variables.
*   **Incremental Debugging:** If the failure is complex, try to build smaller parts of the project incrementally to pinpoint the exact location of the error.
